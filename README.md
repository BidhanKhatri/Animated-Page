# Created a component CardComponent.jsx

- Created a CardComponent
- This component is able to get props like { defaultState, onClick, numbers, title, subtitle }
- Using that Props, I created 3 different dynamic content cards

# Props Uses

- defaultState was used to sate the index like 0, 1, and 2, helps to differencate the card
- onClick was used to set the defaultState value on clicking of div,
- number was used to display the dynamic available courses value, in our senario 23, 05 and 10
- title was used to display dynamic title like All Courses, Upcoming Courses and Ongoing Courses
- subtitle was used to display dynamic subtitle for different cards,
